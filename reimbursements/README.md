Team Copper is happy to reimburse transportation expenses, hotels, Airbnbs, 
and everything allowed by the UC Davis travel policy 
(since we will be using UC Davis to reimburse expenses for this meeting.). 

All requests for reimbursement (other than mileage & parking meters)
must be accompanied by an Itemized Receipt.

Please complete the Travel Reimbursement Worksheet for a refund.
